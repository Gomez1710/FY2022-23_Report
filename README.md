# FY2023-23 Report

The following report is based on my programs recent grant application cycle from August 2022. This is a draft report that I created for my stakeholders using RMarkdown. To view the report please click on the following link https://gomez1710.github.io/FY2023-23_Report/. To view the backend of the report please look for the file that is labled "index.Rmd". The files labeled as "CountyTest.R" and "grad_text_function.R" show the functions that i created to label and format the text that are used in the leaflet maps when clicking on a county.
